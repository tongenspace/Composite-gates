# Fast and high-fidelity composite gates in superconducting qubits: Beating the Fourier leakage limit
Simulation code accompanying the results shown in (...paper).
In order to verify the results downloading the ipynb file and running all the cells is enough. The last part of the file consinst of the different comparisons, including a measure of the convergence of our approach.
