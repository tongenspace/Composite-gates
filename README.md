# Robust, fast and high-fidelity composite single-qubit gates for superconducting transmon qubits
Simulation code accompanying the results shown in the paper.
In order to verify the results downloading the ipynb file and accompanying folders is required. The folders contain pre-computed values for the different solutions. The last part of Composite Pulses.ipynb consinst of the comparisons presented in the paper, including a measure of the convergence of our approach, an annimation showing the bloch sphere path for different solutions, and a fully time-dependent simulation for CP.
