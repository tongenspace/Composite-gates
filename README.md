# Robust, fast and high-fidelity composite single-qubit gates for superconducting transmon qubits
Simulation code accompanying the results shown in the paper.
In order to verify the results downloading the ipynb file and running all the cells is enough. The last part of the file consinst of the different comparisons, including a measure of the convergence of our approach, Ð°n annimation showing the bloch sphere path for different solutions, and a fully time-dependent simulation for CP.
