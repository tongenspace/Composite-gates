# Robust, fast and high-fidelity composite single-qubit gates for superconducting transmon qubits
Simulation code accompanying the results shown in the paper.
In order to verify the results downloading the ipynb file and accompanying folders is required. The folders contain pre-computed values for the different solutions. The last part of Composite Pulses.ipynb consists of the comparisons presented in the paper, including a measure of the convergence of our approach, an animation showing the bloch sphere path for different solutions (which can be seen either by downloading the ipynb file or opening the folder "frames"), and a fully time-dependent simulation for CP.
